      A lot of the work is with open source multimedia frameworks for dealing
      with audio and video. This can be running on anything from a Raspberry Pi

      While delivering high quality software is front and center, that does not
      come at the cost of burning the candle at both ends or giving 120% all
      the time. Your average day should leave you feeling satisfied, not tired.

      The office space is in the middle of Indiranagar, shared with

      make sure the space is comfortable and welcoming.

      The lack of diversity in technology <em>is</em> a problem. We are
      particularly keen on hearing from women and underrepresented communities in
      order to do our part in addressing this.
