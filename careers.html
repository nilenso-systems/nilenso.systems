  <h2 class="section-heading">What We Do</h2>
  <div class="section-content bordered-section">
    <div class="section-content">
      A lot of the work is with open source multimedia frameworks for dealing
      with audio and video. This can be running on anything from a Raspberry Pi
      to a beefy server transcoding content for the web.

    <div class="section-content">
      The projects you will be involved with to start with are
      <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> and
      <a href="https://pulseaudio.org">PulseAudio</a>, but you're likely to be
      delving into <a href="https://alsa-project.org">ALSA</a>,
      <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>,
      <a href="https://linuxtv.org">V4L2</a> and various other places in the
      Linux system stack.

    <div class="section-content">
      Most of our code is in C, C++ and Rust (yay!) but we believe in picking
      the right tool for the job over being dogmatic about language or
      technology.

  </div>

  <h2 class="section-heading">How We Work</h2>
  <div class="section-content bordered-section">
    <div class="section-content">
      While delivering high quality software is front and center, that does not
      come at the cost of burning the candle at both ends or giving 120% all
      the time. Your average day should leave you feeling satisfied, not tired.
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      The office space is in the middle of Indiranagar, shared with
      <a href="https://nilenso.com">nilenso</a>, and we do everything we can to
      make sure the space is comfortable and welcoming.
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      The lack of diversity in technology <em>is</em> a problem. We are
      particularly keen on hearing from women and underrepresented communities in
      order to do our part in addressing this.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="section-heading">Process</h2>
  <div class="section-content bordered-section">
    <div class="section-content">
      We don't believe in high-pressure interviews, theoretical puzzle-solving,
      or questions designed to trip you up. The hiring process is a two-way
      conversation.
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our first conversation will be about getting to know each other, and will
          focus on your work and interests. If you have work that can be shared
          publicly (via Github, for example), we can speak about that too. During
          this, and later conversations, you can and should bring up any questions
          you have about the company, your work, and anything else that is on your mind.
        </li>

        <li>
          If we're both happy with how the first conversation goes, we'll do 1-2
          programming exercises. These will not be logic puzzles, but will be
          designed to validate your knowledge of basic programming and data
          structures.
        </li>

        <li>
          The next steps will be a conversation around compensation. Your previous
          compensation is not a basis for this conversation (we will not ask you
          about it, but you can share this number if you wish to). This is usually
          an awkward part of the hiring conversation, so we encourage you to be
          candid with your thoughts and not hesitate to negotiate.
